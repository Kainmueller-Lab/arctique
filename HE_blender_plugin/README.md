# Run Custom Script Blender Plugin

Small plugin for this repository.
Lets you run the main script of this repository without having to open the file in Blender.

After install (Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install) you can find the plugin in "File -> runscript".

Will not work any more if you alter the name of the file named "HE_tile.py" in the root directory of this repository.
